Recce is a security tool for information gathering and service enumeration written for the OSCP and inspired by Reconnoitre. Based on initial port scans, recce will use this information to enumerate other services such as FTP, SNMP, SMTP etc.

## Getting Started

There are a couple of 3rd party libraries to get Recce running. Below we will go through the 3rd party libraries, so those who are so inclined can check them out before installing.

### Prerequisites

Recce was written with a number of tools in mind, all of these tools come installed in Kali Linux by default, however are avaliable of other Linux distribututions such as Debian and Ubuntu with some fiddling.
- Nmap

### Installing

## Built With

- [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - The one that is installed on most operating systems by default  (Preliminary support for Python 3 has recently been added)
